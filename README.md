# Bingo-1.0
Advancement Bingo (v1.0)

A simple Minecraft advancement bingo game.

Players with op privileges can invoke the 'bingo start' command to start a game of Advancement Bingo. When the game starts, each player in the session is given a bingo card. If a new player joins the session after the game has started, the 'bingo add <player>' command will add the player to the game and give the player a bingo card. Right-clicking on the bingo card will open the bingo card GUI and the close GUI button will hide the bingo card. Click on any square to view the advancement information. If a player loses their bingo card, the op can issue a new bingo card using the 'give <player> bingo:bingo_card' command and no progress or information will be lost. Normal bingo rules apply, the center square is the free square and a player can win by completing five advancement squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Mod options exist to include or exclude minor vanilla advancements such as recipes, major vanilla advancements, and custom advancements. Options also exist to use global or individual bingo cards and advancement completion. If mod options are changed after a game has started, new bingo cards must be generated by using the 'bingo restart' command.
